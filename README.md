# PCA Implementation in Python

This repository contains my implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Python, created as part of my data mining course at university. PCA is an essential technique for dimensionality reduction in data analysis.

## Description

PCA is a powerful method used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets while preserving their variance. In this project, I've implemented PCA from scratch in Python to gain a deeper understanding of its inner workings. Additionally, I've included visualizations to illustrate the impact of PCA on reducing data dimensions while retaining important information.
